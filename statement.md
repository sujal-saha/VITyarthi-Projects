# 📄 Project Statement: Basic Student Records Manager

## 1. 🎯 Problem Statement

The challenge is to develop a fundamental console application that demonstrates mastery over **basic data structure operations** using Python lists. Specifically, the program must handle simple student records (name and mark) and allow users to perform the five core array manipulation tasks: insertion, deletion, searching, updating, and traversal.

The goal is to provide a working model that:
1.  Stores and links parallel data (names and marks) effectively.
2.  Provides a user-friendly menu interface.
3.  Executes array operations accurately based on index or value.

## 2. 🔭 Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is **narrow and focused** on core data structure concepts.

* **In Scope:**
    * Implementing a command-line interface (CLI) with a main menu.
    * Using two basic Python **lists** to store data in parallel.
    * Implementing the five required array operations (Insert, Delete, Search, Update, Traverse).
    * Providing basic error checking for numerical inputs (marks) and index boundaries.
* **Out of Scope:**
    * Using advanced data structures (e.g., dictionaries, objects, classes).
    * Implementing advanced algorithms (e.g., binary search, complex sorting algorithms like Merge Sort).
    * Data persistence (saving records to a file or database).
    * Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## 3. 👥 Target Users

The primary target user for this software is:

* **The Instructor/Evaluator:** To demonstrate understanding of fundamental list/array manipulation logic.
* **A Beginner Python Student:** As a simple, readable example of how to implement core array operations without complex modules or libraries.

## 4. ✨ Features

The application provides the following functional features via the main menu:

| Option | Feature Name | Core Data Structure Operation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Insert Record** | **Insertion** (`list.insert()`) |
| **2** | **Delete Record** | **Deletion** (`list.pop()`, `list.index()`) |
| **3** | **Search Record** | **Searching** (`list.index()`) |
| **4** | **Update Mark** | **Updation** (Index Assignment `list[i] = value`) |
| **5** | **Display All** | **Traversing** (`for` loop over indices) |
| **6** | **Exit** | Program Termination |
